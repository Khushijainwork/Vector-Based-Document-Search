# Vector-Based-Document-Search
This project, titled "Vector-Based Document Search," introduces a Python program named DocSearch.py that implements advanced information retrieval techniques. The program utilizes vector-based matching and inverted index methodologies to enhance document searching efficiency. By processing input from two files, docs.txt and queries.txt, the program accurately retrieves relevant document IDs and their corresponding angles in degrees. It builds a dictionary and inverted index to optimize the search process, focusing on both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, five test cases have been provided for testing purposes, allowing the program to be run seamlessly on the terminal or in a Python environment based on the system configuration. This project serves as a practical demonstration of effective document retrieval using Python, showcasing the application of sophisticated information retrieval algorithms in a user-friendly manner. Explore the code to delve into the intricacies of vector-based matching and inverted index techniques for streamlined document searching.
